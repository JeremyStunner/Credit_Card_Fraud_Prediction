# Credit_Card_Fraud_Prediction
This is an experiment on using different feature engineering techniques to select the best features for building an accurate model for predicting credit card fraud.
 
 In todayâ€™s digital economy, credit card transactions have become an important part of daily life, offering convenience to consumers and efficiency to businesses. However, the increasing volume of these transactions has led to a corresponding rise in credit card fraud, posing significant financial risks to both consumers and financial institutions.
 Thus, building automated models for such a rising problem statement is necessary and AI - ML is the key for it!
 Aim: The objectives of this project are to;

 * Perform Feature selection to get the best features for building an accurate model
 * Use feature selection techniques like correlation plot and ANOVA test to select the best features for building the model
 * Compare the accuracy from the models built from each features produced by the correlation plot and ANOVA test
 * Develop a robust machine learning model that can accurately detect and predict fraudulent credit card transactions in real-time.
